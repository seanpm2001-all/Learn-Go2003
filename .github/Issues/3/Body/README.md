### [Public notice] This is Go! not Go

[Go!](https://github.com/fgmccabe/go/) is the original programming language. It was created in 2003 by [Francis McCabe](https://github.com/fgmccabe/) 

In 2009 when [Google](https://github.com/Google/) created the [Go](https://github.com/golang/go/) programming language, they gave a poor response to Francis, and steamrolled over the language. The 2 have an extremely similar name, but they were created 6 years apart from each other.

If you really want, the link to Googles repository is [here](https://github.com/golang/go/)
